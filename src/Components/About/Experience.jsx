            <h2>HD Creative Studio</h2>
            <p>I have been running my own create freelance business since 2019 and have had the pleasure to work with many awesome small businesses on brand design, web design, creation of marketing materials including social media graphics and also packaging design. I have typically worked with female led businesses in a variety of sectors from skincare, to paper goods, other online service providers and even a therapist.</p>

            <h2>Web Development</h2>
            <p>I attended a Full Stack Web Development programme in Lisbon at the start of 2022. Whilst my passion is for front end development, I wanted to have a good understanding of the whole stack to make me more effective at communicating and working with other developers. As such I have skills in the MERN stack.</p>
