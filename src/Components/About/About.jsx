                    <p>I'm a typical Brit who loves a good cup of tea and a biscuit to dunk. I have had the pleasure of working remotely since 2019 and have enjoyed living in both Bali and Lisbon, where itâ€™s a little sunnier than back home! I love clean, minimal, and slightly edgy design, with pops of colour! I also have a bit of an addiction to cool monospace fonts and tropical pastels.</p>
